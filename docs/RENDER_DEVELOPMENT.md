# Frust - RENDER Development

Version pins owned by the RENDER unit (`frust-render`, `frust-text`). Shared prerequisites, the
GPU smoke gate, the non-default-feature test commands, and the version-pin *policy* live in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md); the unit's design lives in
[RENDER_ARCHITECTURE.md](RENDER_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Version Pins

The pins this unit owns, under [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)'s Version-Pin Policy (pins are
LAW; re-run the row's tripwire after touching it, and never run a blind `cargo update`):

| Pin | Why | Tripwire |
|---|---|---|
| `vello 0.9.0` / `wgpu 29.0.3` (resolves 29.0.4) | `vello` requires `wgpu ^29.0.3`; bumping `wgpu` independently (30.x is ecosystem-latest) breaks the build | `cargo build --workspace --locked` |
| `image =0.25.10` exact (`Image` widget's PNG/JPEG decoder, `png`/`jpeg` only) | Only 0.25.x release whose MSRV equals the workspace `rust-version` (1.88) | fresh MSRV check before bumping, not just `cargo update` |
| `vello_cpu =0.0.9` exact | Experimental CPU render tier (`frust-render`'s non-default `cpu-tier` feature), pre-1.0 unstable API, isolated behind the `SceneSink` encode seam so a breaking bump never reaches the default GPU path | the `cpu-tier` command in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)'s Test section |

The `vello`/`wgpu` pin is also what pins the iOS Simulator's render gap and the vello
bitmap-emoji decode caveat — both recorded in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)'s Known Issues.
