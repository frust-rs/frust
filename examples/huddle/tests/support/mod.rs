//! Shared headless-test harness for the huddle integration tests: a GPU-free
//! paint target, a one-frame helper, a recording waker, an ambient-owner setup,
//! and an async pump-poll loop — lifted from `clean-signals-forgekit`'s own
//! `tests/support/mod.rs` (itself the ForgeKit `examples/inbox` recipe), factored
//! so every `tests/*.rs` file (each its own crate root) can share it. Over the
//! copied base this module additionally carries [`RecScene`] recording
//! rounded-rect geometry (field/button chrome) so a test can locate and tap a
//! button, plus generic [`pointer`]/[`tap`]/[`center`] pointer-event helpers and
//! [`char_key`]/[`named_key`] keyboard-event helpers (lifted from `tests/team.rs`'s
//! original per-file copies and `forgekit-widgets::textinput`'s own test harness)
//! so every `tests/*.rs` file can drive a real synthetic tap or keystroke without
//! re-deriving the event shapes.
//!
//! Not every test uses every helper.
