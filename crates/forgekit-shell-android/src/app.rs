//! The Android app runtime: [`AndroidAppHandle`] (the state behind the opaque
//! JNI handle) and the [`AppTree`] erasure that lets a single non-generic handle
//! drive any app's `State`/`app_logic`.
//!
//! This module is `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`; it owns the same resources
//! the desktop shell's `ShellHandler` does — a [`RenderContext`],
//! [`SurfaceRenderer`], [`TextContext`], reusable [`Scene`], plus the app tree —
//! but is driven by Choreographer-posted JNI frames instead of a winit loop.
//! It contains no `unsafe`; the FFI boundary lives entirely in
//! [`crate::jni_glue`].
