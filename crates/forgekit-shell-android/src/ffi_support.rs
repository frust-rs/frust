//! Android-specific FFI helper: the opaque-handle liveness check.
//!
//! The platform-agnostic plumbing (`guard`, `sanitize_scale`, `logical_size`,
//! the `AppTree` erasure) lives in `forgekit-shell-common` and is imported at
//! its call sites. What remains here is JNI-handle specific: the sentinel check
//! for the `jlong` the JVM passes back into every native call.
//!
//! This carries no `jni`/`ndk`/GPU dependency so it compiles and is unit-tested
//! on the host (`cargo test --workspace`), even though the code that calls it
//! ([`crate::jni_glue`]) is `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`.

/// Whether an opaque handle from the JVM points at a live native side.
///
/// Kotlin initialises `handle` to `0` and every native call is guarded on it
/// (see `ForgeKitSurfaceView`), so `0` means "no native side yet / already
/// destroyed" and must be treated as a no-op rather than dereferenced.
